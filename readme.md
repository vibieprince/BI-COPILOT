# 📊 AI-Powered Business Intelligence Copilot (WIP)

> **Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress  
> **Purpose:** Learning + Building an end-to-end AI-driven analytics system

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Business Intelligence Copilot** is an experimental web application that aims to make data analysis **simple, conversational, and accessible**.

Instead of writing SQL queries or building dashboards manually, users will be able to:

- Upload a CSV dataset  
- Ask questions in **natural language**  
- Instantly receive **charts, insights, and explanations**

This project is being built **step-by-step**, focusing on clean architecture, scalability, and real-world engineering practices.

## 🎯 Goal of This Project

The primary goal is to design and implement an **end-to-end BI system** that:

- Requires **no SQL or BI tool expertise**
- Works with **plain English queries**
- Converts questions into **data analysis + visual insights**
- Respects **data privacy** by processing files in-memory (no storage)

This is both a **learning project** and a **portfolio-grade system**.
